# JB BLOT - MySQL EMPLOYEE TRACKER

[Walkthrough Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nsV2XWelcJB8RqXvwA0HivRcUu1_rb_I/view)

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).  I have built a command-line application to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Technologies Used
